## Online hackathon in support of political prisoners in Russia, December 13-15

## What's going on?

During the summer and autumn of 2019 we've witnessed a new wave of political repressions in Russia. It was caused by series of peaceful demonstations against banning the independent candidates from the elections to the Moscow City Duma. No property was damaged and no violence was carried out by the demonstrators, yet some protesters were arrested and [sentenced to jail](https://meduza.io/en/news/2019/09/03/a-day-of-verdicts-in-moscow-s-cases-against-opposition-demonstrators-is-a-mixed-bag-for-russia-s-opposition).

This September we, representatives of the IT community, wrote [an open letter in support of defendants in the "Moscow criminal case"](https://github.com/developers-against-repressions/case-212/blob/master/README.en.md) which was signed by more than 2000 IT professionals. Numerous open letters were written by other professional communities: priests, teachers, doctors, and [many others](https://meduza.io/en/news/2019/09/19/russian-teachers-doctors-programmers-and-actors-join-orthodox-priests-in-signing-open-letters-against-moscow-repressions). For a moment it seemed like the civil outbreak worked: six prisoners were set free.

But the repression machine hasn't stopped. Those arrested are still in detention centers or under the house arrest, new arrests and trials are coming. As of today, 16 people are under investigation, 7 more were already sentenced to jail. And that's just the "Moscow case" with its huge media coverage, but there are others: the ["Penza case"](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2018/06/20/i-caved-almost-immediately), the ["New Greatness case"](https://meduza.io/en/news/2018/08/27/another-police-informant-emerges-in-a-controversial-case-against-an-alleged-russian-extremist-group), the ["Rostov case"](https://www.rferl.org/a/two-russian-activists-jailed-in-deplorable-act-of-injustice-/30199670.html).

Just today, Sergey Surovtsev, a [MAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Aviation_Institute) graduate who developed [GLONASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS) and worked in Silicon Valley, was arrested. He became the third colleague of ours in this absurd "Moscow case".

## What should we do?

We stand against political repressions and we want to help political prisoners. If you share these views, you've probably already wondered how you can help those in need. There're not that many legal ways left to participate in public life in Russia, but we found one. Please, join us in __the first online hackathon in support of political prisoners!__

This is an opportunity to use code to express yourself and state your position on the topic. Every project showing your engagement will help: data processing, telegram bot, website design — everything counts. From a funny browser game to projects providing specific solutions to organizations. Even if you state you're against political repressions in your website's `console.log` — any type of support is important now. The more active we are the better chances we have to change this whole situation.

## Who can participate?

IT specialists, designers, managers and human rights activists.
